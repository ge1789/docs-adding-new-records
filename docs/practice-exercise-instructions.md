Locate records which should be added to the database.
Use page 245 of the English Catalogue of Books, 1881–1889 (vol. 4) ([EC-v4-p245.png](EC-v4-p245.png)).
Start with line 43 ("Hamley (Sir E.) National Defense…").
Ignore lines which precede line 43.
Continue through the last line ("—— (W. H.) Georgians: …").

Add records for inclusion following [the instructions on adding titles](adding-title-records.md).

Please record how long it takes you to work through the lines.
