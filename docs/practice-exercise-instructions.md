Here are instructions for the practice exercise. You should do this exercise first.

Locate records which should be added to the database.
Use page 245 of the English Catalogue of Books, 1881–1889 (vol. 4), starting with line 43 ("Hamley (Sir E.) National Defense…").
A page image of page 245 is available: [EC-v4-p245.png](EC-v4-p245.png).
Skip lines before line 43. Start with the line which starts with "Hamley (Sir E.) National Defense…".
Continue through the last line ("—— (W. H.) Georgians: …").

Add records for inclusion following [the instructions on adding titles](adding-title-records.md).

Please record how long it takes you to work through the lines.

When you have finished, please send the collection form to the person who gave you the task.
